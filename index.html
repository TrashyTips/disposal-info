<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Look for fewer moving parts, buttons, or digital electronic readouts that could break. Simpler is better.<br /><br />Look for stainless steel construction for durability and recyclability at the end of the product&rsquo;s life.<br /><br />Compare warranties before you buy your new appliance. A longer warranty period indicates a manufacturer&rsquo;s confidence in its product. Although no one likes to think about repairing a purchase that hasn&rsquo;t even been paid for yet, consider the ease of repair as part of your purchasing decision.</p>

<p>The proceeds from recycling used holiday lights sent to <a href="http://www.christmas-light-source.com/Christmas-Lights-Recycling-Program_c_210.html" title="Christmas light source">Christmas light source</a> are used to donate books to Toys for Tots.<br /><br />Holiday lights can be sent to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.holidayleds.com/christmas-light-recycling-program.aspx" title="HolidayLEDs.com">HolidayLEDs.com</a> in exchange for a coupon for new energy efficient LED holiday lights during their seasonal holiday-light recycling program.</p>
<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Compact fluorescent (CFL) lights contain small amounts of mercury. Take these back to a retailer that accepts CFLs, such as <a href="http://www6.homedepot.com/ecooptions/stage/pdf/cfl_recycle.pdf" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10744/" title="Ikea">Ikea</a> or <a href="http://www.lowes.com/cd_recycling_368967519_" title="Lowes">Lowes</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Replacing incandescent bulbs with CFLs reduces energy costs and waste. CFLs use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Most hardware stores carry a variety of energy-efficient compact fluorescents in shapes designed to fit fixtures both in and outside your home. CFLs and fluorescent tubes do contain minimal amounts of mercury, but are safe to use. If you break a bulb, follow the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html#flourescent" title="Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines">Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines</a> to ensure your safety.</p>

<h1>Batteries </h1>
<p><b>Garbage:</b> It's illegal to discard auto batteries, backup batteries, and rechargeable batteries in the regular garbage. Other batteries, like alkaline batteries, may be discarded in the regular trash, but it is more environmentally friendly to bring to a SAFE Disposal Event or to DSNY Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site.</p>
<h2>SAFE Disposal Events &amp; Drop-Off Sites</h2>
<p>You can take any batteries to an upcoming <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/safe-disposal-events.shtml" title="SAFE Disposal Events">SAFE Disposal Event</a>, or to any <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/special-waste-drop-off-sites.shtml" title="Household Special Waste Drop-Off Sites">Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent the risk of fire, individually bag each non-alkaline battery or use CLEAR tape to cover the terminals before dropping them off. Do not use opaque tape and do not bag or tape alkaline batteries. </p>
<p>Note: Alkaline batteries are not classified as hazardous in New York State and may be discarded in the regular trash. However, it is more environmentally friendly to bring to a SAFE Disposal Event or to DSNY Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site.</p>
<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p><b>Auto batteries.</b> It is illegal to discard a car battery in the garbage or recycling or on the street. Auto batteries can be recycled at service stations or auto supply stores that sell them. <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/auto-batteries.shtml">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p><b>Button batteries</b> may be accepted at a jewelry store, watch repair shop, or camera store. Call ahead to verify.</p>
<p><b>Rechargeable batteries.</b> Bring rechargeable batteries and small items that contain rechargeable batteries to stores in New York State that sell them, such as a pharmacy, office supply, or hardware store (except not small food stores). The stores must accept up to ten batteries of the same shape and size that they sell, free of charge. Ask for the Call2Recycle box.  </p>
<p>To find a drop-off location, visit <a href="http://www.call2recycle.org/" title="Call2Recycle">Call2Recycle</a>.</p>

<h1>Christmas Trees </h1>
<p><b>Composting: </b>Weather permitting, DSNY will collect and compost clean Christmas trees left at the curb from Monday, January 4, 2016 through Friday, January 15, 2016. The trees are chipped, mixed with leaves, and recycled into rich compost for NYC's parks, institutions, and community gardens. Remove all lights, ornaments, stands, and plastic bags from your tree; trees that still have these items attached will be collected as garbage.<br /><br /><b>Recycling: </b>Remove ornaments from fake trees that are mostly metal or rigid plastic, and put out next to your recycling container on regular recycling days.<br /><br /><b>Garbage: </b>Except for the dates indicated in early January, Christmas trees are collected as garbage. Discard fake trees that are not mostly metal or rigid plastic with regular trash.</p>
<h2>Make Your Own Mulch</h2>
<p>Use evergreen boughs and branches from your Christmas tree as mulch to enrich the soil in your garden or street tree beds. Just cut off the smaller branches of your Christmas tree, and remove the twigs from evergreen boughs. Lay three to four inches of these trimmings over the bare soil around street trees or in your garden. After removing the branches for mulch, you can take your tree to <a href="http://nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/mulchfest" title="MulchFest">MulchFest</a> or leave it out for DSNY collection.</p>

<h1> Who Picks Up Recycling and Garbage for Businesses </h1>
<p>Businesses must arrange to have garbage and recyclables removed by a <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/html/trade_waste/customer_info.shtml">licensed carting company</a>, though owners can also apply for <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/bic/html/forms/forms.shtml">permission</a> from the Business Integrity Commission (BIC) to haul their own waste. (In most cases, however, using a private carter is easier and less expensive.)</p>
<h2>Carter Services</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2015, DSNY and BIC conducted an informal <a href="/assets/dsny/docs/NYC-Carter-Services-Survey-Results.pdf">carter services survey (PDF)</a> in order to assist businesses in finding a private carter that suites their needs. The survey was sent to all NYC licensed carters, but completing the survey was voluntary. As such, not all private carters responded. The results of this survey were self-reported by the private carter and were not verified for accuracy by DSNY or BIC.</p>
<h2>Alternative to Private Carting â&euro;&ldquo; Professional Fee Program</h2>
<p>DSNY offers a convenient alternative to private carter service for professional services, such as physicians and lawyers who conduct business in residential buildings. Through this fee-based service, DSNY will collect recyclables and garbage. The annual fee is based on the estimated average number of 20-gallon bags of recyclables and garbage that your business generates per week. You may qualify if your business is in a DSNY-serviced building and you meet any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are authorized by law to engage in an occupation in a residential location that also serves as your home.</li>
<li>You or your group are licensed NYS physicians, dentists, accountants, lawyers, chiropractors, or other licensed professions with a practice located in a basement or on the first or second floor of a residential building.</li>
<li>You are engaged in a profession located in a residential portion of the building that has been used for the same occupational purpose since December 15, 1961.</li>

<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Compact fluorescent (CFL) lights contain small amounts of mercury. Take these back to a retailer that accepts CFLs, such as <a href="http://www6.homedepot.com/ecooptions/stage/pdf/cfl_recycle.pdf" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10744/" title="Ikea">Ikea</a> or <a href="http://www.lowes.com/cd_recycling_368967519_" title="Lowes">Lowes</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Replacing incandescent bulbs with CFLs reduces energy costs and waste. CFLs use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Most hardware stores carry a variety of energy-efficient compact fluorescents in shapes designed to fit fixtures both in and outside your home. CFLs and fluorescent tubes do contain minimal amounts of mercury, but are safe to use. If you break a bulb, follow the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html#flourescent" title="Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines">Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines</a> to ensure your safety.</p>

<h2>Other Electronics</h2>
<p>Electronic equipment not specifically covered by local or state regulations (such as loose cables, cameras, GPS devices, and microwaves) can be discarded in regular garbage.&nbsp; Items made of mostly metal or rigid plastic can be recycled with other metal/glass/plastic items.</p>
<p>See options for <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/batteries.shtml" title="rechargeable batteries">rechargeable batteries</a> and <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/cell-phones.shtml" title="cell phones">cell phones</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Buy a good-quality product. It may cost more up-front, but it will last longer and save you money in the long run.</p>
<p>Buy electronics manufactured with fewer hazardous chemicals. Products rated as <a href="http://www.epeat.net/">EPEAT</a> Gold, Silver, or Bronze meet certain product and manufacturer standards. EPEAT stands for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool and is an on-line tool that compares computer desktops, laptops, and monitors based on their environmental attributes.</p>
<p>Rather than buying new, try upgrading what you have. For broken items, try repairing before replacing.</p>

<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Compact fluorescent (CFL) lights contain small amounts of mercury.

<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Replacing incandescent bulbs with CFLs reduces energy costs and waste. CFLs use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Most hardware stores carry a variety of energy-efficient compact fluorescents in shapes designed to fit fixtures both in and outside your home. CFLs and fluorescent tubes do contain minimal amounts of mercury, but are safe to use. If you break a bulb, follow the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html#flourescent" title="Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines">Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines</a> to ensure your safety.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>E-Waste Recycling Events. </b>Bring electronics to an electronics recycling event, such as the <a href="http://www.lesecologycenter.org/programs/ewaste/collection-events/">Lower East Side Ecology Center</a> events.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h2>Other Electronics</h2>
<p>Electronic equipment not specifically covered by local or state regulations (such as loose cables, cameras, GPS devices, and microwaves) can be discarded in regular garbage.&nbsp; Items made of mostly metal or rigid plastic can be recycled with other metal/glass/plastic items.</p>
<p>See options for <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/batteries.shtml" title="rechargeable batteries">rechargeable batteries</a> and <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/cell-phones.shtml" title="cell phones">cell phones</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Buy a good-quality product. It may cost more up-front, but it will last longer and save you money in the long run.</p>
<p>Buy electronics manufactured with fewer hazardous chemicals. Products rated as <a href="http://www.epeat.net/">EPEAT</a> Gold, Silver, or Bronze meet certain product and manufacturer standards. EPEAT stands for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool and is an on-line tool that compares computer desktops, laptops, and monitors based on their environmental attributes.</p>
<p>Rather than buying new, try upgrading what you have. For broken items, try repairing before replacing.</p>

<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Bring used sharps to any hospital or nursing home in New York State; they are required to act as collection centers for used household sharps, including syringes and lancets, with no identification required. Make sure that sharps are packaged safely, and call hospitals and nursing homes for drop-off times and instructions prior to taking materials to their facility.<br /><br />Many CVS Pharmacy, Rite-Aid, and Walgreens locations offer the Sharps Compliance Inc. medication disposal system, which allows customers to mail their unwanted prescription and over-the-counter medications to Sharp Compliance's Texas facility for disposal. Check at the pharmacy counter to purchase postage-paid envelopes or boxes for this mail-back. <a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/index.html" title="Controlled substances">Controlled substances</a> are excluded from the program.<br /><br />Check the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/67720.html" title="Safe Drug Disposal Options">Safe Drug Disposal Options</a> for additional periodic drop-off events.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html" title="U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's National Take Back Initiative">U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's National Take Back Initiative</a> has information about&nbsp;drop-off events for prescription drugs, including&nbsp;controlled substances.</p>
<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>Certain medications can be <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/medical-equipment.shtml" title="medical equipment">donated</a> to be used by people who need them.</p>
<h2>Low-Level Radioactive Waste</h2>
<p>Patients who are receiving home health care or recently released patients receiving radiation therapy carry radioactive material in their biological system (usually Iodine 131). This radioactive material can be excreted into tissues, diapers, or sanitary napkins. Do not dispose of these contaminated items in the trash or toilet. If possible, segregate the material in a closed bin and keep in a location away from people, so that the radiation can naturally dissipate prior to disposal.</p>

<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Look for fewer moving parts, buttons, or digital electronic readouts that could break. Simpler is better.<br /><br />Look for stainless steel construction for durability and recyclability at the end of the product&rsquo;s life.<br /><br />Compare warranties before you buy your new appliance. A longer warranty period indicates a manufacturer&rsquo;s confidence in its product. Although no one likes to think about repairing a purchase that hasn&rsquo;t even been paid for yet, consider the ease of repair as part of your purchasing decision.</p>

<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Compact fluorescent (CFL) lights contain small amounts of mercury. Take these back to a retailer that accepts CFLs, such as <a href="http://www6.homedepot.com/ecooptions/stage/pdf/cfl_recycle.pdf" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10744/" title="Ikea">Ikea</a> or <a href="http://www.lowes.com/cd_recycling_368967519_" title="Lowes">Lowes</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Replacing incandescent bulbs with CFLs reduces energy costs and waste. CFLs use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. Most hardware stores carry a variety of energy-efficient compact fluorescents in shapes designed to fit fixtures both in and outside your home. CFLs and fluorescent tubes do contain minimal amounts of mercury, but are safe to use. If you break a bulb, follow the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cfl/cflcleanup.html#flourescent" title="Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines">Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidelines</a> to ensure your safety.</p>

Consider using latex paint that is low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as an environmentally preferable option if you&rsquo;re concerned about indoor air quality and odor.<br /><br />Use less-toxic paint thinners or strippers. Avoid thinners or strippers that contain methylene chloride, a potential cancer-causing agent. Consider thinners or strippers that are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs).<br /><br />Remove lead paint responsibly. Never dry-scrape or dry-sand to remove paint, especially if your home was built before 1960. <br /><br />Select the right amount of paint and paint products for each job. It takes approximately one gallon of paint to cover 350 square feet of smooth surface. Talk to your local paint retailer or use a paint calculator to determine how much paint you need:</p>

Plastic bags alone comprise almost 3% of New York City's residential waste stream&ndash;the largest source of plastic in NYC's waste.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/50034.html" title="New York State's Plastic Bag Reduction, Reuse and Recycling Act">New York State's Plastic Bag Reduction, Reuse and Recycling Act</a> requires certain retail stores in NYC and State to accept plastic carryout bags, newspaper bags, dry cleaning bags, shrink wrap, and clean food bags.<br /><br /><b>Flexible Plastic Packaging:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades.html" title="Terracycle">Terracycle</a> collects difficult-to-recycle materials that use flexible plastic packaging, such as drink and food pouches. Schools, community groups, and individuals can sign up for Terracycle &ldquo;brigades&rdquo; and get credits for recycling these materials.<br /><br /><b>Disposable Coffee Pods: </b>Empty and rinse disposable coffee pods before recycling with your metal, glass, and plastic.

<h1>Batteries </h1>
<p><b>Garbage:</b> It's illegal to discard auto batteries, backup batteries, and rechargeable batteries in the regular garbage. Other batteries, like alkaline batteries, may be discarded in the regular trash, but it is more environmentally friendly to bring to a SAFE Disposal Event or to DSNY Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site.</p>
<h2>SAFE Disposal Events &amp; Drop-Off Sites</h2>
<p>You can take any batteries to an upcoming <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/safe-disposal-events.shtml" title="SAFE Disposal Events">SAFE Disposal Event</a>, or to any <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/special-waste-drop-off-sites.shtml" title="Household Special Waste Drop-Off Sites">Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent the risk of fire, individually bag each non-alkaline battery or use CLEAR tape to cover the terminals before dropping them off. Do not use opaque tape and do not bag or tape alkaline batteries. </p>
<p>Note: Alkaline batteries are not classified as hazardous in New York State and may be discarded in the regular trash. However, it is more environmentally friendly to bring to a SAFE Disposal Event or to DSNY Household Special Waste Drop-Off Site.</p>
<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p><b>Auto batteries.</b> It is illegal to discard a car battery in the garbage or recycling or on the street. Auto batteries can be recycled at service stations or auto supply stores that sell them. <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/auto-batteries.shtml">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p><b>Button batteries</b> may be accepted at a jewelry store, watch repair shop, or camera store. Call ahead to verify.</p>
<p><b>Rechargeable batteries.</b> Bring rechargeable batteries and small items that contain rechargeable batteries to stores in New York State that sell them, such as a pharmacy, office supply, or hardware store (except not small food stores). The stores must accept up to ten batteries of the same shape and size that they sell, free of charge. Ask for the Call2Recycle box.  </p>

<h2>Other Electronics</h2>
<p>Electronic equipment not specifically covered by local or state regulations (such as loose cables, cameras, GPS devices, and microwaves) can be discarded in regular garbage.&nbsp; Items made of mostly metal or rigid plastic can be recycled with other metal/glass/plastic items.</p>
<p>See options for <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/batteries.shtml" title="rechargeable batteries">rechargeable batteries</a> and <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/cell-phones.shtml" title="cell phones">cell phones</a>.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>Buy a good-quality product. It may cost more up-front, but it will last longer and save you money in the long run.</p>
<p>Buy electronics manufactured with fewer hazardous chemicals. Products rated as <a href="http://www.epeat.net/">EPEAT</a> Gold, Silver, or Bronze meet certain product and manufacturer standards. EPEAT stands for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool and is an on-line tool that compares computer desktops, laptops, and monitors based on their environmental attributes.</p>
<p>Rather than buying new, try upgrading what you have. For broken items, try repairing before replacing.</p>

<h2>Take-Back or Drop-Off</h2>
<p>Businesses that sell or install tires must take back tires of approximately the same size that they sell. The fee for the collection of old tires is included in the cost of new tires. You can recycle up to the same number of tires that you buy new.</p>
<h2>Purchasing &amp; Usage Tips</h2>
<p>Buy retreaded tires. Retreading bonds new tread to the existing tire body using a process very similar to the manufacture of a new tire.<br /><br />Always check tire pressure when the tires are cold. Use the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended pressure.<br /><br />Watch for tears or bulges in the tire tread or sidewall and have the tire checked immediately and replaced if necessary.<br /><br />Rotate tires according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations to ensure that the tires wear at a uniform rate. Check tire balance and alignment to reduce excess wear.</p>

<p>Buy a good-quality product. It may cost more up-front, but it will last longer and save you money in the long run.</p>
<p>Buy electronics manufactured with fewer hazardous chemicals. Products rated as <a href="http://www.epeat.net/">EPEAT</a> Gold, Silver, or Bronze meet certain product and manufacturer standards. EPEAT stands for Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool and is an on-line tool that compares computer desktops, laptops, and monitors based on their environmental attributes.</p>
<p>Rather than buying new, try upgrading what you have. For broken items, try repairing before replacing.</p>

<h1> Vehicle + Bike Laws </h1>
<h2>Abandoned Vehicles</h2>
<p>No person may cause any vehicle to be abandoned. There is a rebuttable presumption that the last registered owner of an abandoned vehicle caused the vehicle to be abandoned. Owners must arrange for proper disposal of their unwanted vehicles (search for &ldquo;Automobile Wrecking&rdquo;). Failure to pay any Fines for abandoning a vehicle can result in suspension of the license of a New York State driver or denial of a license to an unlicensed driver.</p>

<p><i>Fine:</i> $250&ndash;$1,000</p>
<h2>Spillage from Truck/Receptacle</h2>
<p>No person in control of a vehicle or receptacle may litter, drop, spill, or allow to be littered, dropped, or spilled any dirt, sand, gravel, or other material in or upon any street or public place.</p>
<!--&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related Law: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://72.45.128.254/nyc/adcode/Title16C1_16-118.asp"&gt;&sect;16-118(4)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;-->
<p><i>Fine: </i>$100&ndash;$450</p>
<h2>Uncovered Vehicles/Transportation of Loose Cargo</h2>
<p>An open truck or trailer being utilized for the transportation of any loose substances may not be operated on any public street or highway unless the truck or trailer has a cover, tarpaulin, or other device approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation. The cover must completely close the opening on the truck or trailer while it is being operated to prevent any substances from falling/spilling out. However, the covering is not necessary if the load is arranged so that no loose substances can fall from or blow out of the truck.</p>

<p><i>Fine: </i>Up to $300</p>
<h2>Derelict Bicycles</h2>
<p>DSNY is authorized to classify, based on specific criteria, certain bicycles that are affixed to public property as derelict, and allow for their removal and disposal. Public property includes any city property and includes those bicycle racks that are installed by the Department of Transportation (DOT), but does not include DOT&rsquo;s Bikeshare Program.</p>
<p>DSNY is not authorized to remove for disposal from public property any bicycles that do not meet the derelict bicycle criteria or ghost bikes (also known as memorial bikes).</p>
<p>Once DSNY makes the determination that a bicycle is derelict, DSNY shall affix a notice to the bicycle advising the owner that the owner has seven days from the date of such notice to remove the derelict bicycle. This notice shall also state that the failure to remove such bicycle within the designated time period will result in the removal and disposal by recycling of the derelict bicycle by DSNY. .</p>
