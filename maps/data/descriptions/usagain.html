<h4>About</h4>
<p>USAgain (pronounced "use-again") is a for-profit company that collects unwanted textiles and resells them in the U.S. and abroad, effectively diverting millions of pounds of clothing from landfills, generating new revenue streams for U.S. businesses and non-profits, and fueling local economies in emerging countries.</p>
<p>Founded in 1999, USAgain operates over 12,000 collection bins in 16 states. In 2015 alone, USAgain collected 50.7 million pounds of clothing, shoes, and other textiles. Headquartered in Chicago and operating 11 division offices, USAgain employs over 160 people.</p>

<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>At USAgain, we work for people, for planet and for profit. Our mission is to make a positive impact for people and planet by operating a sound and sustainable business, following the highest ethical standards. Our goal is to make textile reuse easy and convenient and maximize waste reduction.</p>
<p>For People: We contribute to the well-being of those whose means give only the choice of no new clothes or used new clothes. We also provide a source of income for people with job opportunities at our company here in the US and for those in developing countries who resell the clothes we supply.</p>
<p>For Planet: We contribute to the sensible use of our land by transforming clothing and textiles into reusable and valuable products rather than letting them waste away in landfills. Extending the life of clothing preserves precious resources and reduces polluting emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>For Profit: We are proud to run a modern company that is growing and creating jobs in a sustainable green industry. Behind every USAgain clothing drop box is a trained team of employees from the local area. We contribute to the local and state economy by paying salaries and taxes, and purchasing goods and services from other local businesses. We also contribute to the success of other non- and for-profit recycling endeavors by providing a consistent and reasonably priced source of good reusable clothing for resale.</p>
<p>USAgain redistributes the discarded clothes we collect to places where there is a great need for these items, supporting the local and global economy in the process. By exporting textiles to struggling countries we generate revenue, create green jobs here in the US and abroad, and help to improve the well-being of people in America and around the world.</p>
<p>We're leading the charge to encourage the re-wear, re-use and recycling of clothes and other textiles. Extending the life of clothes and shoes reduces environmental degradation from the manufacturing of new clothing and makes for a healthier planet. Through our work, we hope to encourage people to consider sensible use of our planet's land and resources.</p>
<p>Together, we can work to give clothes a second life and make the world a better and cleaner place for people to live.</p>
